# CDLite #

This is an old MFC program that I wrote way back in the dark ages of 2003. I found it on an old hard drive, so decided to dust it off and see if I can get it running again so that I can listen to CDs at work with it.

## The Original Blurb ##

CDLite is designed to be a light weight CD player that does just one thing and does it well. Over the years, CD players for windows have grown in size and complexity. I wanted a small player that is unobtrusive and allows me to do listen to CDs and not get in the way while I work in other programs. To meet these needs, CDLite uses very little screen space, very few system resources and as little memory as possible. It does all of this and still looks good on your desktop and is fully and easily skinable so that anyone can quickly change the way the program looks.

## ToDo List ##

- ~~Convert to Unicode~~
- Create an installer
- Determine viewable area on multiple screens for docking
- Glitch sometimes where a 5 appears after the track when stopped.
- Add my new default skin to the repository from my home computer.
- ~~Update the HTML help page.~~
- Option to dock in the title bar of the application that has focus?
- Add the shuffle option or remove menu option until next version.
- ~~Provide feedback that help is being launched?  Maybe a dialog that
  pops up then automatically disappears?~~
