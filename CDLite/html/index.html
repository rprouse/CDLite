  <h2>CDLite Help</h2>

  <p>CDLite is designed to be a light weight CD player that does just 
  one thing and does it well.  Over the years, CD players for windows have
  grown in size and complexity.  I wanted a small splayer that is unobtrusive
  and allows me to do listen to CDs and not get in the way while I work in 
  other programs.  To meet these needs, CDLite uses very little screen space,
  very few system resources and as little memory as possible.  It does all
  of this and still looks good on your desktop and is fully and easily skinable so
  that anyone can quickly change the way the program looks.
